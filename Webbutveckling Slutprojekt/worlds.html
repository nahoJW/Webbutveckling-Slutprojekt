			<p>The League of Legends World Championship is the annual professional League of Legends world championship tournament hosted by Riot Games and is the culmination of each season. Teams compete for the champion title, the 70-pound (32-kilogram) Summoner's Cup, and a US$1 million championship prize.[1] In 2018, the finals were watched by 99.6 million people, breaking 2017's finals' viewer record.[2] The tournament has been praised for its ceremonial performances,[3][4] while receiving attention worldwide due to its multiple dramatic and emotional series.[5][6][7] A donation of US$2 million was raised through the sales of the Worlds 2017 Championship Ashe skin.[8] LA 2024, which is overseeing the Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics was inspired by the growing success of League of Legends World Championship and is considering to plan and include esports in the Olympic Games if they win the bid. Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA 2024, suggested using technology used in certain segments of League of Legends Worlds such as augmented reality and virtual reality to make the Olympics more accessible to a younger demographic. The League of Legends World Championships has gained tremendous success and popularity, making it among the world's most prestigious and watched tournaments, as well as the most watched video game in the world. Due to its success, esports scenes became prominent and widely seen as a potential Olympics event, already being included as a medal event in 2022 Asian Games.[9][10][11][12][13][14] The tournament is known to rotate its venues across different major countries and regions each year in a rotating manner. South Korea's SK Telecom T1 currently holds the highest record of wins, with three world championship wins (2013, 2015, and 2016).
